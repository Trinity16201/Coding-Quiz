# Coding-Quiz
My motivation for this was to develop a better understanding of timers, JS, and overall functionality.The purpose is to showcase various functions learned over the entire course so far. It also, in my opinion, was a way to test our resourcefulness. 

I have learned a lot, especially regarding the timer element. I had done so many revisions and received a lot of help, but it took my teacher along with BCS to finally get this to work correctly. I've spent much longer than I anticipated on this project. I had help from a friend in the field, BCS Learning assistant x4, a Tutor, and office hours.

Although my project does not have all the functionality I was intending to have based on the acceptance criteria, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.
