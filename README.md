# Coding-Quiz
My motivation for this was to develop a better understanding of timers, JS, and overall functionality.The purpose is to showcase various functions learned over the entire course so far. It also, in my opinion, was a way to test our resourcefulness. 

I have learned a lot, especially regarding the timer element and visibility options. I had done so many revisions and received a lot of help, but it took my teacher, my TA's, a Tutor, BCS, some of my classmates, and a friend to finally get this to work correctly. I've spent much longer than I anticipated on this project, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
